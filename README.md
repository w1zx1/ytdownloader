# ytdownloader
a simple video downloader from youtube that downloads videos in mp4 or mp3 using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (and does nothing more!)
# warning
### choose 1080p when you really need it, as videos over 720p will require recoding to mp4 (takes some time and makes your pc unusable while its going)
